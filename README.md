# Real-time license plate detection and blurring using openCV and Python 3.6

#### Note - Please go through the 'license_plate_detector.ipynb' file to get an overview of the code.

#### Quick summary-
 - The code detects Indian car's license plates and blurs it. The code is written in python 3.6 and openCV 4.1.0 is used for image processing.
 - The algorithm used is Haar Cascade a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source.
 - Here the Haar cascade is trained for license plate of cars in India.
 - 'india_license_plate.xml' file is the trained Haar cascade classifier attached.
 
#### Libraries used-
 - Open CV
